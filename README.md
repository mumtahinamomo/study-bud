## What is StudyBud?

StudyBud allows students to upload **all materials for a class**—lecture slides, notes, readings, textbooks, and recordings—into a single class folder. The AI deeply understands everything inside that folder and acts as a **personal AI tutor**, answering questions, generating notes, quizzes, and even audio summaries **based only on that class’s content**.

StudyBud is designed for:
- Understanding concepts (not just summarizing)
- Studying in short, fragmented time blocks
- Reducing planning and organization overhead
